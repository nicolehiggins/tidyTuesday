This week's data is about the BeyoncÃ© and Taylor Swift songs. Read more about it, including definitions of variables, [here](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2020/2020-09-29/readme.md). Enjoy!

Please delete all the unneeded code and instructions. Remember to tweet out your graph with `#TidyTuesday` and `#MacTidyTuesday` hashtags if you'd like. If you want me to tweet it out for you, please take a screenshot (command+shift+4 on a Mac ... Google how to do it on a Windows) and add it to this [Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lTcvc59CwptUtqmVXSl47zRFOMZEFtLQDCa00zaV_90/edit?usp=sharing). Be sure to have your name either on the graph somewhere (I'd recommend adding a caption or tag label) or right above the graph in the Google Doc. Thanks!
